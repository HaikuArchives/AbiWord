INTRODUCTION
------------

Welcome to AbiWord for MacOS X. For more information visit our
website <http://www.abisource.com/>

This directory contains source code Apple ProjectBuilder projects
to build wv, expat, popt, libpng and fribidi as MacOS X frameworks
and everything almost else required to build AbiWord.

If you have gotten this source from CVS by checking out the CVS module 
abicocoa, then you have almost everything that is need to build. 
It still needs you to fetch the fribidi source which should be unpacked in 
the "fribidi" directory inside current directory (should be a sibling of abi). 
You need to run the configure script located in the fribidi directory.
See <http://fribidi.sf.net/>

You also need Fink <http://fink.sf.net/> with glib2, libiconv, libxml2 and
imagemagick  installed (any other installation can be fine, but you'll have to
tweak the projects and support scripts as they currently rely on fink, and this
can be more difficult than you might think).

AUTO BUILD
----------

There is an automatic build script.
Run ./build_all.sh

This will build in the selected directory a deployment version of AbiWord directly
installable by drag and drop (all libraries embedded).
Default build dir is ./tmp, but you'll be asked to select one first. If you want to 
reconfigure, edit .config (as a shell script) or delete it.

Building for Jaguar on Panther:
------------------------------
Currently, a recompiled fink on Panther is not compatible with Jaguar. You need
Jaguar compatible version of the library. In that case, export the path were to
find the Jaguar compatible .dylib into the environment variable FINK_DEPOT_DIR.


MANUAL BUILD
------------

Tell Project Builder to build everything in a separate location.
I use ~/tmp/pbx but anything else will be fine. To do that, 
open Project Builder and got to Preferences -> Building
If you prefer you can set each project individually.

Build in this order:
	poptpbx
	fribidipbx
	pngpbx
	wvpbx
	enchantpbx
	abipbx

For abipbx, you MUST, the first time, build the target "PNGs" which is not by 
default in order to convert all the XPM to PNG.

Frameworks don't need to be installed: they'll be embedded during the
build of AbiWord.app. 
abipbx project will also take of embedding the Fink libraries.
